## EasyEngine Documentation

Online documenataion is available at https://rtcamp.com/easyengine/docs/

You can also run `man ee` command to read local docs.

Also running incomplete `ee` commands will give you contextual documents.

For example:

`ee` 					=>		will list avialable modules 
`ee site`				=> 		will list available commands in `site` module
`ee site create`		=> 		will list available args for `create` commands in `site` module

**Note:** You can also run `ee help` which is same as `ee`.
